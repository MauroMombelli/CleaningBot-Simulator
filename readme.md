This is a 2d simulation evironment for a simple rover.

The idea is to simulate a simple room, and the sensors from the rover, and let the users experiment implementing their own AI;
the simulation can be used to test AI behaviur.

This simulation is incentrated on creating a smarter AI for cleaning robot; once developed it will be tested with a real cleanin robot.

Since the actual target is still in use, the project is on hold. If interested open an issue.

Licence of the simulation is GPL, this means any AI you will develop should be opensource too.
